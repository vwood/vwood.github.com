Agile Methodology from first principles.

Start with the simplest thing that could possibly work.
"Cowboy Coding" Every does what they think is best.
(i.e. No methodology)

* Make employees want to add value to the company
* Employees can make decisions (and if they can't then why haven't you replaced them with a machine already)

Axiom: Proceed in a greedy way, test a change and see if it improves.

Communication is hard: 
Documentation (but how much/when?), meetings (few), talking

Focus is required in short amounts
Planning is required (why are you doing what you are doing, was it successful, what should I do now?)

Publish your software with an example use case. This is like testing but the tests should be executable by users. This is important as it is the users who use the software. Unittests show how developers should use APIs (If you're lucky and they don't bypass the actual APIs in the name of testing)
