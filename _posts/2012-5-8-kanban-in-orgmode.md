I read a post on using [orgmode with Kanban](http://www.agilesoc.com/2011/08/08/emacs-org-mode-kanban-pomodoro-oh-my/). I consider Kanban to be a simple method that helps track tasks and ensure that progress gets made.

Tasks are tracked on a board like this:

*INSERT BOARD*

I use css rules in emacs to get the layout...

Links

C-c C-e t to import templates to the file
(and then remove most of them)

C-c C-e b to export to my browser

Change some settings for sanity

Automatic export on changes

Automatic entries in table?
Automatic TODO/DONE? - find the source of whatever does links in orgmode.

Shifting entries functions
