================
<p class="meta">10 July 2012</p>

The following software is horrible, and I resent having to touch it

* MSSQL Server
* Java
* Java EE
* setargv.obj
* Eclipse
* Maven

Fortunately there are sane alternatives to all the above so you have only yourself (or your employer) to blame.


What is a Vector?
=================
(Or rather, what is stored as a vector?)

The weights to a single node in a neural network form a vector. A particular document, treated as a bag of words, is a vector (relative to a particular vocabulary). The values here correspond to the term frequencies (normalised or not). There is the obvious geometric interpretation as a direction (vector) in n dimensional space. It can also represent a point in n dimensional space. This also describes a plane through the origin, or an arbitrary plane in an n-1 dimensional space with the nth item as a displacement along the normal. A non-normalised categorial distribution, or the values for a dirichlet distribution.
