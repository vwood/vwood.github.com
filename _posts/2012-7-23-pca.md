Problems encountered in eigenfaces

Finding training data at all
Getting data into grayscale numpy arrays
Removing the mean face
view the mean face 
view everypart to identify when you go wrong, and verify your results
Eigenfaces are likely negative
eigh vs eig (eigh is *much* quicker)
When to limit the eigenvalues?
Can be complex (forget how I solved this?)

Create the noisy/eigenised faces by converting into a short eigenvector, then dotting back

Have to find some publishable faces
