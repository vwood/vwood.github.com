So I've wanted to do some webscraping. So I took a look a scrapy. It's a framework, so it's crap and tries to take over any project it's in[^1]. This is thanks to Twisted being shit.

So let's use mechanize and libxml2.


[^1]: All frameworks suck. They're heavyweight, and limiting. Libraries are much better.


Python language mistakes:
lambda
statement/expression
map, and, or
conflats let with set (no warning for incorrect names)
shitty scoping rules
explicit return
packages are crap
default values are broken
self.x = x
preference for frameworks rather than libraries
