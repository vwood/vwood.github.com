* Ideas 
** PCA, ICA - semantics
** Language models (N Grams)
pymantics
alternate means of storage
back + forward n gram models
storing multiple models (via metadata in the postings)
the : {123 : {'a': 1, 'v': 10}} where 'a' & 'v' are different n-gram models
need to track a total model as well
** Raytracing
** wificracking 
yay4internet, str4nger, WEP vs WPA, McDonalds WIFI
** Lisp language
Dispatch
Type-inference
Interface-inference (Parameterised types?)
** Sockets & serialization
Lisp sexps
Shared Structs (Hashed checksums for types?)
Add distribution to threads + channels
And serialization to file (pausing and saving state is important for distributed progging.)
checksums for values
How to perform distribution - (distribute code as well) - for RMI
** APIs
*** Lisp
*** Python
conventions enforced by syntactic sugar (__len__, __getitem__, __setitem__) etc.
*** Bash
*** Mobile touch screens (blocky)
*** vim vs Emacs
** Open source - making it easy to send patches
** Open source - documentation (tutorials, examples and so on)
** General GUI/Game framework project
** JAVA reflection (towards a Java REPL and object inspector, or just using JDB)
** Documenting other gists, and other repos
*** Schelling model
*** Willpower game
*** Disjoint sets (perhaps with type inference or cave joining algs.)
*** Short Python3 search engine
*** Wind
pygame -> pyglet
textbox, canvas so on
integration testing (via examples)
Building an emacs like texteditor
evaluation of python within python
*** Do something with HMMs or EDA/BOA
*** Something about markov chains
Possibly related to N-grams
